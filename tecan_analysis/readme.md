This folder has two md files:

different_growth_models.md: explains the 3 different growth models one can use to fit,

tecan_analysis.md: explains how to load tecan data, examine it, fit growth rates

To use the code in them you must have the files "growthcurve_functions.r" and "tecan_funcs.r" sourced.
